This folder contains samples to work with TMF API's.

## What is this?
The TMForum is an alliance of 850+ global companies working together to break down technology and cultural barriers between digital service providers, technology suppliers, consultancies and systems integrators.

They defined a common API model as a common standard for the telecommunication industry.

The definition file "tmf_definition.json" defines the core objects and patterns of this standard and can be easily enhanced.
