This sample contains two directories:
- datafull
  This will contain a full set of all available records of the api's
- datareduced
  This will contain a reduced set of records which are building a logical combination

In both directories there is a commandfile "getDataFiles" to download the corresponding data using the curl command.

The commandfile "makeplaceholderall.cmd" can be used as an example to generate the files.

"placeholderdefinition.json" is the definition file which is used for converting the data.
