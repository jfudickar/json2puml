What is this?
The Star Wars API, or "swapi" (Swah-pee) is the world's first quantified and programmatically-accessible data source for all the data from the Star Wars canon universe!
We've taken all the rich contextual stuff from the universe and formatted into something easier to consume with software. Then we went and stuck an API on the front so you can access it all!


Where do I find it?
You can use the API's from "https://swapi.dev"

You can source the json source files from : https://github.com/Juriy/swapi
You will find the data files here : https://github.com/Juriy/swapi/tree/master/resources/fixtures
